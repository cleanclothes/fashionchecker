  methodology_title: "Our Research Methodology"
  methodology_paragraph_1: >
    We sent more than 90 brands questionnaires to give them the opportunity to showcase
    the efforts they are making towards paying a living wage to all workers in their supply
    chain and to disclose their production locations (if they had not done so through the
    Transparency Pledge). Our emphasis is on expressing the brands’ efforts to pay a living
    wage through SMART data collected via this research in a transparent and
    comprehensive format for consumers, garment workers and policy makers. It is hoped
    that, in the long term, brands representation on Fashion Checker will become a
    component of a brand’s due diligence and CSR validation process.
  methodology_paragraph_2: >
    Because of the challenging context, including workers’ reluctance to speak with
    researchers for fear of reprisal, field research at workplace level has initially only been
    carried out in five countries where access to garment workers is guaranteed;
    Indonesia, China, Croatia, India and the Ukraine. We collected workers’ payslips,
    conducted interviews to interpret the information the payslips provide, disaggregated
    by gender (e.g. on gender pay gaps, work responsibilities, working hours,bonuses,
    overtime). We then checked these wages against the response given by brands on their
    living wage benchmarks and the percentage of suppliers paid according to this
    benchmark. We will be adding data from more countries as this project progresses.
